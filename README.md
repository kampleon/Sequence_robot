This Repo consists of all raw instron data and post processing code to reproduce the results of the paper. it has four components:
1 - Folders with the raw instron data (rubber_bands: contains measurements for the stiffness of the spring, 1 unit: testing of the units cell, 2 units: testing of the 2 unit mechanism)
2 - 1unit_code.ipynb, containing all code needed for post-processing the data around the unit cell (fig 1 + some SI plots)
3 - 2units_code.ipynb, containing all code needed for post-processing the data around the two-unit mechanism (fig 2 + some SI plots)
4 - 3D model of the robot
